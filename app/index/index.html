			<div class="title">Why Should My Build Be Green?</div>
			<div class="body">
				If you’ve ever been part of the storming phase at a new shop, you have have probably been asked the question “Why would I want to maintain a green build?”. Because this is not an uncommon question, you probably have two or three pre-canned answers from right off the top of your head. Although you can rattle off these responses, how many times have you ever reflected on exactly why you answered in that way, or possibly even worse, do you even agree with the responses that you’ve given?

One of the major issues with becoming comfortable working within an organizational framework, in this case Agile, is that you sometimes fall into the pattern of rattling off responses to questions without even giving them a second thought. It doesn’t take us long to want to tell folks about the benefits of having stand up every day at 10 AM once you’ve been doing it for a while.

So then, why should my build be green? I’ve thought a lot about a general answer for this question lately, and every time I can never reach an answer I’d be happy giving that would apply to every project utilizing continuous integration that I’ve ever been part of. Some of the answers that I’ve heard to this question include: “We don’t want to hold up the rest of the developers from delivering value” or “If we want to cut a release we know that in any instance our code is in a good state”. These two responses, although decent enough to get some of the doubters to go away,  assume a few things that do not apply to every group attempting to maintain a green build.

How can we get the answer to this question down to its most basic form? How can the answer apply to all applications?

After thinking about components of the Agile Manifesto, the tenant “working software over comprehensive documentation” can be used to build up a foundation to answer this question in satisfactory terms. In agile, I’ve come accustomed to value working software over all else. If our software isn’t working properly, all of the blood, sweat, and tears we’ve put in as a team over the last iteration is all for nothing. How can we know our software is working properly? We know our software is working when our build is green. A build being green means something different in every use case. In some shops, a green build may signify that all unit tests pass and in another it can show that a compilation is running in under a certain amount of time.
